### Description

The first ICQ client made in VB, at the moment, it can send receive message/url. Check user's online/offline status, change status to Invisible, Away, N/A, etc.
 
### More Info
 
This is only a preview of the current ICQ client that is still under construction. This is very basic and some of the function might still have some error, as I have not implement much error trapping in it.
